## Introduction
Squid (Simplifying Quantitive Imaging Development and Deployment) provides a full suite of hardware and software components for rapidly configuring high-performance microscopes tailored to users' applications with reduced cost, effort and turnaround time. Besides increasing accessibility of research microscopes and available microscope hours to labs, it is also designed to simplify development and dissemination of new or otherwise advanced microscopy techniques.

Applications include
- slide scanner for digital pathology
- time lapse imaging with 2D or 3D tiling
- spatial omics that involves multicolor and multi-round imaging
- tracking microscopy
- computational microscopy, including label free microscopy using phase/polarization/reflectance + deep learning
- super resolution microscopy
- light sheet microscopy

## Acknowledgement
The Squid software was developed with structuring inspiration from [Tempesta-RedSTED](https://github.com/jonatanalvelid/Tempesta-RedSTED). The laser engine is inspired by [https://github.com/ries-lab/LaserEngine](https://github.com/ries-lab/LaserEngine). 

## Software Instructions
The microscope is controled by an Arduino Due and a computer running Ubuntu. The computer can be one of the Nvidia Jetson platforms (e.g. Jetson Nano, Jetson Xavier NX) or a regular laptop/workstation. Instructions for using the firmware and software can be found in the respective folders.
